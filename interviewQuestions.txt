1. Tell me a little bit about yourself?
 - The goal of this question is for the interviewer to get to know you
 - I should explain where i came from
 - what ive done, the jobs ive had
 - what got me into coding
 - what lead me to apply for this job

2. What kind of work environment are you looking for in the next opportunity you take?
 - the goal of this question is so the interviewer can see if you are a good fit for the company
 - the key to this question is to try to find out WHAT kind of environment the company would have and play that up in your answer
 - is the company fast paced and incorporate AGILE? I should bring up any experience i have with working in AGILE and what i liked about it
 - the best way to answer this type of question is to be 'flexible' or neutral
 - talk about how i am good at adapting and flexible to any work environment
 - relate my answer to the company culture and show how i would be a good fit
 - research the company work environment, look at the about us page of their website
 
3. What are your strengths and weaknesses as a developer?
 - with this question the interviewer is looking for honest, self-awareness and the ability to learn from mistakes
 - dont say things like "im a perfectionist" or other cliched answers
 - examples of strengths would be things like analytical skills, communication skills/leadership skills and the ability to collaborate and work as a team
 - examples of weakness could be things like hard or soft skills, hard skills would be things i need to study to learn like programing and soft skills would be something like time management 
 - when answering questions about strengths and weaknesses always keep the JOB DESCRIPTION in mind
 - frame the answer in a way that emphasizes the qualities the hiring manager is looking for
 -  focus on strengths you have that are required for the job
 - try to put a positive spin on your weaknesses by showing how you are actively trying to improve that weakness
 - dont share a universally diqualifying answer like how i am always late
 - dont mention weaknesses that would make me unfit for the position

5. Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years?
 - this question is asked because because the interviewer wants to know if your career goals align with the company's
 - even if i plan on leaving quickly i should keep that information to myself
 - research a reasonable career path that would flow from the position that i am applying for 
 - if it is a junior software engineering job it would make sense that i would want to eventually become a senior software engineer for example
 - discuss my interest in the job i am applying for, i should want to master my current position before moving on

6. How would your co-workers describe you?
 - this question is asked to get a sense of how you view yourself, to compare your self assessment to how your references describe you, and to see how good your soft skills are
 - i should focus on my qualities that would make me a good fit for the job
 - look at my linkedin recommendations to see what people say about me
